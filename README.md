## About

Hi! I'm Carolina but please call me Carol :)
<br>
Since 2019 I've been studying about programming languages and now I work as a software developer @ Procenge, where I deal with some challenges mostly with Angular framework.
<br>
I really enjoy how Git (and Github/Gitlab) can help our lifes when we write code.
Sometimes I like to write about stuff I'm learning, and you can read my blog posts [here](https://COAB1.github.io/blog)

## Public Speaking

I really like to give back some of my knowledge to the comunity, here you can find some of activities through the year
