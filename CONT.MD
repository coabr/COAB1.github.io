### Volunteer & Community
17 in total

Work for the IT community to help them, and me, to grown.

| Date        | Event            | Role  |
|:-----------:|------------------|:-----:|
| 2019 | [The Developers Conference - Florian√≥polis](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br) | Volunteer |
| 2019 | [Construnir](https://www.instagram.com/construnirengenharia/) | Front end developer & UI volunteer |

<!-- #### Facts
 * The Developers Conference is the largest IT event in Latin America with more than 20k attendees in five different cities in Brazil.
 * The Developers Conference TDC4Women Track was created to increase diversity and female representation at the event, this track had 9 editions, and in 2019 we realized that it was no longer needed, as women already actively participate in all the event's tracks. Goal achieved!
